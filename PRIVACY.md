# Our Privacy Policy

*Updated on July 5, 2017.*

Hi, there!

We've got a couple of snippets of JS that are collecting info from the hopp site to help
us ensure that users are able to find their way around hopp as needed. This privacy policy
will breakdown for you the info we collect and how we use it.

## Confidentiality

Your information will never be disclosed to anybody who hasn't signed an NDA with us
(us being 10244872 Canada Inc.). So don't worry about us selling your info, trading it for
coffee, or posting it on Github.

## What are we collecting?

Currently, we're collecting the default info that Google Analytics collects (things like
IP address, country from where you accessed it, the site that brought you to us, etc.). For
a detailed list of this, please check out Google Analytics.

We also have a snippet from [Inspectlet](https://www.inspectlet.com/) which does a bit more.
It tracks your mouse movements and clicks to give us a heatmap of general usage of the site.
This might seem a bit creepy but it's very useful for optimizing the design of a website.

## Why the hell do we need it?

Open Source is hard to get off the ground. We use these analytics services to collect info
that is driving users away from hopp - info that isn't presented to us by those users. For instance,
our heatmaps can tell us things like "looks like users are never clicking 'plugins' - that link might
suck". That way we can make sure we improve on those tips by doing things like adding a curated plugin
list.

## Can I opt-out? I'm a bit of a privacy freak.

If you don't want this info to be recorded, please don't visit the site. By visiting the site, you are
automatically opting into this privacy policy and having your info be recorded.
